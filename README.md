# Git Art 🎨🚀

Welcome to **Git Art** – the project that turns your commit history into a masterpiece! Why settle for a boring green contribution graph when you can make it a canvas for your creativity? 😄

## What is Git Art?

Git Art is a quirky Java Swing application that lets you "paint" your GitHub contributions. By backdating commits, you can design a custom pattern on your contribution graph. Whether it's doodles, text art, or your latest inside joke, Git Art transforms your Git history into an art gallery. 🖌️

## Features

- **Interactive Grid**: A 7×53 grid mimicking GitHub’s contribution chart where you can toggle cells on or off.
- **Text Rendering**: Type in your favorite message and watch it convert into commit art! ✍️
- **Year Modes**: Switch between a dynamic "Current Year" mode (last 365/371 days) and fixed calendar years.
- **State Persistence**: Your grid state is saved for each mode, so switching between years won't erase your hard work.
- **Handy Buttons**:
  - **Select All**: Toggle every cell in the grid.
  - **Select Weekdays**: Toggle only the cells representing weekdays.
  - **Random Fill**: Let randomness take over your art (for those feeling adventurous 🤪).
  - **Clear All**: Erase your art from every mode.
  - **Max Fill**: Go big or go home—fill every cell in every mode!
- **Commit Generation**: Automatically generate commits with backdated timestamps to recreate your art on GitHub.
